    <p>The Gavilan was created in May of 1983 by Manuel (Manny) Fernandez. The Gavilan had an affordable price compared to other laptops at a price of 4,000 which today would be at a price of $10882.73. It is operated by a floppy disk drive and MS-DOS system, however; it does contain other compatible parts of other devices. It was also powered by  a 5 MHz Intel 8088 processor. It was designed with a terminal system, MS-DOS and MBasic system. It had a good amount of storage and memory and they tried to improve it after it had been released to the public. For example, the use of plug-in modules. This device had a printer attached to the back of the laptop. Its screen was able to fold over the keyboard when necessary. Its appearance was altered and designed by Jack Hall, an award-winning industrial designer. It weighed around 9 pounds and was one of the technological advances of this time. It is powered by nickel-cadmium which allows it to stay alive for up to 9 hours. It was designed to operate with diverse types of software. It had a resolution of 400 by 64 pixels. Therefore, it has a higher resolution that allows the viewers to view it more clearly. On the screen of this device was a touchpad that was located above the keyboard. However, this technology was not accepted very well by the public because the laptop industry has not developed fully. It was discontinued by its company in 1985. </p>
