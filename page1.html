      <p>     The first Laptop was created by Adam Osborne and designed by Lee Felsenstein. The <italics>Osborne I</italics> was inspired by other products, and it was developed from a CP/2.2 software system. It was produced by the Osborne Computer Corporation. This laptop was first popular in 1981 and contained many functions such as a monitor, a disk drive, etc. This device also had games, spreadsheets, and other advancements. However, this device lacked many vital parts that make it a successful device. For example, <italics>The Osborne I </italics>lacked a battery which required the device to be plugged in constantly. Another negative aspect of this technology was that it was not easily movable considering that it weighs 24 1/2 pounds. Even though it weighs more than today's laptops, it was known for its portability, and it had a handle that made it easier to move. Around 11,000 laptops were sold to the public. The <italics>Osborne</italics> had a 5-inch screen that later caused problems with sell rates because of more advanced and larger screens. For example, a laptop was developed called the Kaypro which had a 9-inch screen and was Osborne’s biggest threat to the product. More laptops came out with better technology from Apple and other industries. Due to the public moving on to improved products, Osborne’s company was left in a poor financial state. In conclusion, this laptop was a good start to the technological timeline and altered technology’s history. This laptop has significantly changed the world and how technology is involved in it. </p>
