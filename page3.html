    <p>Compaq was released in 1988, two years after the Osborne I, as Compaq Computer Corporation’s product and became known as a success for their company. Some positive aspects that made it popular were the internal hard drive, the VGA graphics, and the battery power. Compared to earlier laptops, 3 hours of battery life was a major improvement. It was based on the SLT/286 computer system and was one of the smallest laptops anyone has ever created. It was originally created to be carried on a plane, and its size made it a very conventional laptop, weighing only 14 pounds. One improvement that they made was a detachable keyboard and this made Compaq easier to use. It sold at an average price of 5,699 dollars. This laptop had high resolution display and battery power saving techniques. This is the second IMB PC computer that can run all software that can operate on an IMB personal computer. This advancement altered laptop’s history. The Compaq Computer Corporation sold around 1 billion dollars (about $3 per person in the US) worth of sales by 1988. Other companies saw the accomplishments and progress that this laptop had made and started selling laptops like it. However, Compaq did not lose its popularity and continued to flourish. The foundation Of the Compaq Portable was used in the creation of the Compaq Desktop. This laptop allowed their company to create more products like this one. </p>
