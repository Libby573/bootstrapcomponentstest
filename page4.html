    <p> The Macintosh Portable was produced in 1989 by Apple. This device was sold for 6,500 dollars however, this device failed because of flaw in battery design. It was the first battery-powered Macintosh but, there were major flaws in this device. It was designed like a model of the Atari ST computer and is where its creator got his inspiration. It weighs around 16 pounds and was one of the least successful Apple products. It had a 1.44 MB double-sided floppy drive, 40 MB 3.5″ Conner hard drive. There were three options for software when purchasing this laptop: a floppy drive, two floppy drives, or one hard drive and one floppy drive. It had graphics of 640 × 400 pixel, 1-bit and can show black and white visuals. One flaw that this device expressed was the inability to view the screen in low light environments. They tried to create a backlit feature to repair the problem, however, it reduced the battery life significantly. It had a mass of 16 pounds which is a good weight for laptops of this time. However, it had a bulky appearance, and the battery is made from lead-acid. In an attempt to add extra functions, the laptop’s appearance was taken advantage of. It had an active-matrix screen that made it a more expensive product. It was discontinued in October 1991 based on these details. Technology has advanced in many ways since then. Apple has recognized the designer flaws in this technology and has been able to correct them over the past several years. </p>
